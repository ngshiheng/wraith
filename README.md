# Wraith

[![shellcheck](https://github.com/ngshiheng/wraith/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ngshiheng/wraith/actions/workflows/shellcheck.yml)

A simple utility Bash script to backup [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) publishing platform. This script enables Ghost users to quickly and easily back up their entire platform, including the MySQL database.

## Context

Getting started with Ghost is easy. You would pick between:

-   [Managed](https://ghost.org/pricing/) service
-   Self-hosted on a [VPS](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/ghost) or serverless platform like [Railway](https://blog.railway.app/p/ghost)

Using managed version will most likely save you a bunch of headaches (and time) that come along with self-hosting any other sites:

-   Backups
-   Maintenance
-   Downtime recovery
-   Security, etc.

In short, youâ€™d sleep easy at night while they stay awake.

Having that said, if you want to take on the challenge of self-hosting your own Ghost site, here's a tiny script to help with your backups.
